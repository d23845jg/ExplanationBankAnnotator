UBC9 is the sole conjugating enzyme in sumoylation and plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis and restraining stress reactions. However, the clinical significance and function of UBC9 in bladder cancer remain unclear. In this study,\u00a0immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of UBC9. UBC9 knock-down and SUMO inhibition were conducted followed by proliferation, migration, and cell cycle assays. RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were used to identify potential mechanisms of UBC9. Cytokine membrane antibody array was used to detect the expression of cytokine. The mass cytometry TOF (CyTOF) was used to explore the association between bladder cancer stem cell-like population and UBC9 expression. Our results showed that\u00a0UBC9 played a dual role in bladder cancer. UBC9 was up-regulated in bladder cancer, but was negatively correlated with TNM stage and grade.

The emergence of L. pneumophila is linked to several traits selected in the environment, the acquisition of some of which involved intra- and interkingdom horizontal gene transfer events. Transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) is a powerful method to identify the genetic basis of selectable traits as well as to identify fitness determinants and essential genes, which are possible antibiotic targets. TIS has not yet been used to its full power in L. pneumophila , possibly because of the difficulty of obtaining a high-saturation transposon insertion library. Indeed, we found that isolates of sequence type 1 (ST1), which includes the commonly used laboratory strains, are poorly permissive to saturating mutagenesis by conjugation-mediated transposon delivery. In contrast, we obtained high-saturation libraries in non-ST1 clinical isolates, offering the prospect of using TIS on unaltered L. pneumophila strains. Focusing on one of them, we then used TIS to identify essential genes in L. pneumophila . We also revealed that TIS could be used to identify genes controlling vertical transmission of mobile genetic elements. We then applied TIS to identify all the genes required for L. pneumophila to develop competence and undergo natural transformation, defining the set of major and minor type IV pilins that are engaged in DNA uptake.

Therefore, it is useful to know what impact tumor transformation may have on the forensic interpretation of the results obtained from the analysis of these polymorphisms.

The evaluation of genomic instability was performed comparing InDel and STR genotypes of tumor samples with those of their healthy counterparts. Results : With regard to STRs, colorectal cancer was found to be the tumor type affected by the highest number of mutations, whereas in the case of InDels the amount of genetic mutations turned out to be independent of the tumor type. However, the phenomena of genomic instability, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI), seem to affect InDels more than STRs hampering genotype attribution.

Both Hbs containing the \u03b2K82D mutation showed considerably less cysteic acid formation, a byproduct of cysteine irreversible oxidation. Next, we performed a novel study aimed at exploring the impact of introducing \u03b2K82D containing Hbs on vascular endothelial redox homeostasis and energy metabolism. Incubation of the mutants carrying \u03b2K82D with endothelial cells resulted in altered bioenergetic function, by improving basal cellular glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Treatment of cells with Hb variants containing \u03b2K82D resulted in lower heme oxygenase-1 and ferritin expressions, compared to native Hbs. We conclude that the presence of \u03b2K82D confers oxidative stability to Hb and adds significant resistance to oxidative toxicity. Therefore, we propose that \u03b2K82D is a potential gene-editing target in the treatment of sickle cell disease and in the design of safe and effective oxygen therapeutics.", "PMC7763657", "None", "The Providence Mutation (\u03b2K82D) in Human Hemoglobin Substantially Reduces \u03b2Cysteine 93 Oxidation and Oxidative Stress in Endothelial Cells", "Sirsendu Jana, Michael Brad Strader, Abdu I.

Studies have shown that exposure to the outdoors (as a means of contact with nature) reduces perceived stress and promotes health and wellbeing among varying populations in many settings. To date, however, there are few studies exploring the impact of nature contact among college students, especially in the United States. In addition, the determinants of nature contact behavior have not adequately been explored using behavioral theories. The purpose of this study was to use the multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change, a contemporary fourth-generation behavioral theory in explaining intentional outdoor nature contact behavior among college students. Using a cross-sectional design, 401 students completed the validated survey based on MTM. Of these, 281 met the inclusion criteria. The mean score for perceived stress based on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) in the sample was 21.60 (7.08) units, with a possible minimum and maximum scores ranging from 0 to 40 units. Constructs of behavioral confidence (standardized coefficient = 0.591, p < 0.001) and changes in the physical environment (standardized coefficient = 0.271, p < 0.001) from MTM accounted for 57.5% of the variance in the initiation for intentional outdoor nature contact behavior. All the three constructs of MTM\u2014namely, emotional transformation (standardized coefficient = 0.173, p = 0.021), practice for change (standardized coefficient = 0.317, p < 0.001), and changes in the social environment (standardized coefficient = 0.204, p = 0.002)\u2014were statistically significant and contributed substantively toward the variance (31.0%) in sustenance.

Although mutations in MutY homolog ( MUTYH ) are best known for MUTYH associated polyposis and colorectal cancer, it plays a role in the development of ovarian cancer. In this review, we discuss the function of the MUTYH gene, mutation epidemiology, and its mechanism for carcinogenesis. We additionally examine its emerging role in the development of ovarian cancer and how it may be used as a predictive and targetable biomarker. MUTYH mutations may confer the risk of ovarian cancer by the failure of its well-known base excision repair mechanism or by failure to induce cell death. Biallelic germline MUTYH mutations confer a 14% risk of ovarian cancer by age 70. A monoallelic germline mutation in conjunction with a somatic MUTYH mutation may also contribute to the development of ovarian cancer. Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents may be seen in tumors with monoallelic mutations, but platinum sensitivity in the biallelic setting. As MUTYH is intimately associated with targetable molecular partners, therapeutic options for MUTYH driven ovarian cancers include programed-death 1/programed-death ligand-1 inhibitors and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors.
